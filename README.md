Hadoop Java KMeans for Iris dataset

with Hadoop 2.6.0 , java 1.7

You can excute with command :
hadoop jar KMeansForIris.jar KMeansForIris {iris dataset path} kmeans {k clusters} {threshold}  

Threshold :
It will stop clustering when the distance between with Every centroids' new position and last position is smaller than threshold value. 

Experimental Result:
Iteration: 4 times
Execution Time: 53 sec.
